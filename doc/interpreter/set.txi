@chapter Sets

Octave has a limited number of functions for managing sets of data, where a
set is defined as a collection of unique elements.  In Octave a set is
represented as a vector of numbers.

@node Set Operations
@section Set Operations

Octave supports the basic set operations.  That is, Octave can compute
the union, intersection, and difference of two sets.
Octave also supports the @emph{Exclusive Or} set operation, and
membership determination.  The functions for set operations all work in
pretty much the same way.  As an example, assume that @code{x} and
@code{y} contains two sets, then

@example
union (x, y)
@end example

@noindent
computes the union of the two sets.
